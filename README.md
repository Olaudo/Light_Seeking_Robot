# Introduction
Welcome to the Light Following Robot project! This is an exciting endeavor where we'll be building a smart robot capable of autonomously following the brightest light source in its environment. Using Arduino and some basic components, we'll delve into the realms of robotics and learn how to harness light sensors to guide our robot's movements.

# Components Required
To embark on this journey, you'll need the following components:

# Arduino Uno or similar microcontroller board
Two DC motors
Motor driver (L298N or similar)
Light sensors (LDRs - Light Dependent Resistors)
Chassis for the robot
Wheels
Battery pack
Jumper wires
Breadboard (optional)
Circuit Diagram
Before we dive into the intricacies of the project, let's take a quick look at how the components are connected. Refer to the provided circuit diagram for a clear understanding of the setup.


# How It Works
Here's a brief overview of how our Light Following Robot operates:

Light Sensing: Equipped with Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs), the robot continuously measures the intensity of light in its surroundings.

Movement Control: Utilizing the readings from the light sensors, our Arduino brain calculates the direction where the light is brightest.

Motor Control: Signals from the Arduino are transmitted to the motor driver, which then orchestrates the movement of our robot. Depending on the light distribution, the robot turns left, right, or moves forward accordingly.

Continuous Adaptation: This process occurs in a continuous loop, ensuring that our robot dynamically adjusts its movement to track the brightest light source.

Setup Instructions
Let's get started with setting up our Light Following Robot:

Component Connection: Carefully connect all the components according to the provided circuit diagram.

Upload the Code: Upload the Arduino code provided in the code directory to your Arduino board.

Power Up: Power up the Arduino and place the robot in an area with varying light intensity.

Watch it Go!: Sit back and witness your creation in action as it adeptly follows the brightest light source in its vicinity.

Code Explanation
Our Arduino code is the heart and soul of our robot's intelligence. It utilizes analogRead() to gather data from the light sensors and employs clever algorithms to determine the optimal movement direction. Motor speeds are adjusted using digitalWrite() commands to ensure smooth navigation.

Customization
Feel free to customize your Light Following Robot according to your preferences:

Speed Control: Adjust the motor speeds by tweaking the values in the Arduino code.
Sensitivity Settings: Fine-tune the sensitivity of the light sensors by modifying threshold values in the code.
Behavioral Tweaks: Experiment with different behaviors based on light intensity readings. For instance, implement logic to halt the robot if light intensity drops below a certain threshold.
Troubleshooting
Encountering issues? Here are some troubleshooting tips:

Robot Not Responding: Double-check your connections to ensure everything is properly hooked up.
Erratic Behavior: If your robot's behavior seems unpredictable, try adjusting the sensitivity of the light sensors or calibrating it to the ambient lighting conditions.
